Welcome to my ambitious python 2 & 2.5D game engine project! Just going to see how far I can go with this project.
Here are some features I would like to have for the engine. If I progress far into development, then I will add more.

- Graphics module (pygame)
- Audio module
- Physics module
- Mathematics module
- UI module
- Sprite & tile editor
- File system
- Robust settings menus
- Embeded scripting language
