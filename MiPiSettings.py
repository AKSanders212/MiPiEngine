Remove lines of code for npcsprite = False @ 161 and playersprite = False @ 192. 
These were bandaid fixes. You added them, so as to remove duplicate sprites, 
but one sprite is actually the npc and the other is the player. 
You want multiple sprites on the screen, so do not let duplicates confuse you!
